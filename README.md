📊 A Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
Welcome to the "A Data Warehouse and Analytics Project" repository.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution — from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. It is a training practice project directly adapted from Baraa Data Analysis Tutorial.

🏗️ Data Architecture
The project follows the Medallion Architecture, consisting of three layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.

Bronze Layer
Raw data ingested as-is from source systems (e.g., CSV files) into a SQL Server database.

Silver Layer
Data is cleansed, standardized, and normalized to prepare it for analysis.

Gold Layer
Contains business-ready data, modeled in a star schema for reporting and analytics.

📖 Project Overview
This project covers:

Data Architecture
Designing a modern data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture.

ETL Pipelines
Extracting, transforming, and loading data from various sources into the warehouse.

Data Modeling
Creating fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

Analytics & Reporting
Generating SQL-based reports and dashboards to provide actionable business insights.

🎯 Who Is This For?
