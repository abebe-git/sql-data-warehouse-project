# **📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project**

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!

This project, created by Data with Baraa, showcases a complete data warehousing and analytics solution. From building a modern data warehouse to generating actionable insights, this portfolio project follows industry best practices in both data engineering and data analytics.

# **🏗️ Data Architecture**

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers: 
![Data Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2388fef-4e7d-40ec-b298-ad21747f3744)
1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.&#x20;
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

# 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

### **Objective** 

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### **Specifications** 

* **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
* **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
* **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
* **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
* **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
