📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 
This project, created by Data with Baraa, showcases a complete data warehousing and analytics solution. From building a modern data warehouse to generating actionable insights, this portfolio project follows industry best practices in both data engineering and data analytics.

🏗️ Project Requirements

🔹 Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
Objective
Gain hands-on experience in developing a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data for analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

Specifications
o	Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
o	Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues before analysis.
o	Integration: Combine both data sources into a single, user-friendly data model optimized for analytical queries.
o	Scope: Focus only on the latest dataset (no historization required).
o	Documentation: Provide clear, accessible documentation of the data model for both business and technical audiences.

🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers: 
 ![Data Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c9a83ff-bb44-44e4-846e-96e58f27ca6c)

1.	Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2.	Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3.	Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
   
📖 Project Overview

This project involves:
1.	Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
2.	ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3.	Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4.	Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.
