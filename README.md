📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!

This project, created by Data with Baraa, showcases a complete data warehousing and analytics solution. From building a modern data warehouse to generating actionable insights, this portfolio project follows industry best practices in both data engineering and data analytics.

🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers: 



Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database. 

Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.

Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

📖 Project Overview

This project involves: 

Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.

Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

Objective 

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

Specifications 

Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.

Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.

Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
